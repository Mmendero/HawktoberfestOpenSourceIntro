Hello everyone! My name is Anthony and I'm currently a Junior pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science. 
Aside from interests in Computer Science, I'm also very into headphones and box office numbers. 
Unforutanely, due to current situation in the world, box office numbers are no longer something to marvel at.
I hope for things to someday return to some semblance of normalcy. 
Until then, I try to stay optimisitic and I have a lot more time listen to music over different pairs of headphones.
Very excited to begin hacking for Hawktoberfest 2020!
